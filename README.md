# Reinforcement Learning-Driven Adaptive Model Selection and Blending for Supervised Learning
Inspired by Deepseeker: Dynamically Choosing and Combining ML Models for Optimal Performance
Machine learning model selection has always been a challenge. Whether you're predicting stock prices, diagnosing diseases, or optimizing marketing campaigns, the question remains: which model works best for my data? Traditionally, we rely on cross-validation to test multiple models - XGBoost, LGBM, Random Forest, etc. - and pick the best one based on validation performance. But what if different parts of the dataset require different models? Or what if blending multiple models dynamically could improve accuracy?
This idea hit me while reading about Deepseeker R1, an advanced large language model (LLM) that adapts dynamically to improve performance. Inspired by its reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, I wondered: can we apply a similar RL-driven strategy to supervised learning? Instead of manually selecting a model, why not let reinforcement learning learn the best strategy for us?
Imagine an RL agent acting like a data scientist - analyzing dataset characteristics, testing different models, and learning which performs best. Even better, rather than just picking one model, it could blend models dynamically based on data patterns. For instance, in a financial dataset, XGBoost might handle structured trends well, while LGBM might capture interactions better. Our RL system could switch between them intelligently or even combine them adaptively.
This paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning-Driven Model Selection and Blending framework. We frame the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where:
The state represents dataset characteristics.
The action is selecting or blending different ML models.
The reward is based on model performance.
The policy is trained using RL to find the best model selection strategy over time.

Unlike traditional approaches that apply a single best model across an entire dataset, this RL-driven method learns to choose the best model per data segment, or even blend models dynamically. This approach can automate, optimize, and personalize machine learning pipelines - reducing human intervention while improving predictive performance.
By the end of this paper, we'll see how reinforcement learning can transform model selection, making it adaptive, intelligent, and more efficient - just like a skilled data scientist who constantly learns and refines their choices.
